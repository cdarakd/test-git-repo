Python tool where given a list of test-cases, and a command-line tool to perform
firmware upgrades, it needs to do the following:

- Run an external command and capture output
- Dissect/parse output to determine the relevant information
- Be able to run one test-case from the command line or to retrieve a file (
containing test -cases).
